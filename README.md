# 📌 Discord Feedback Scraper

This **Discord Scraper** is designed to gather and analyze feedback from a dedicated feedback channel within your community's Discord server. It streamlines feedback collection and sentiment analysis, helping you gain meaningful insights.

## 🔐 Implementation Approaches

You have two main ways to integrate this scraper:

1. **Using a Pre-Approved Bot**
   - Utilize an existing bot like [Suggest Bot](https://suggester.js.org/#/).
   - Configure relevant emojis to capture sentiment through user reactions.
   - The scraper collects both the original feedback and the sentiment expressed via reactions.

2. **Structured Feedback Channel**
   - Create a channel where users submit feedback through a structured form.
   - Post these submissions for community members to react and provide their opinions.
